# Part 8: Advanced Topics â€“ DAOs, Layer 2, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs

## Topics

* Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
* Layer 2 scaling solutions
* Zero-Knowledge Proofs and zk-SNARKs

## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

### What is a DAO?

A DAO is an on-chain organization governed by smart contracts and token holders, with no central authority.

### Key Characteristics

* Fully autonomous and transparent
* Governed by proposals and voting
* Funds managed by code, not people

### Example DAO Platforms

* [Aragon](https://aragon.org/)
* [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/)
* [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/)

### Sample Governance Flow

1. Member submits a proposal
2. Token holders vote
3. Smart contract executes based on results

## Layer 2 Scaling Solutions

Ethereum Layer 1 is secure but expensive and slow. Layer 2 solutions improve scalability.

### Rollups

Batch transactions and submit them to Ethereum in compressed form.

#### Types:

* **Optimistic Rollups**: Assume transactions are valid, dispute if necessary

  * Examples: Optimism, Arbitrum
* **zk-Rollups**: Use zero-knowledge proofs to validate batches

  * Examples: zkSync, Starknet

### Benefits

* Reduced gas fees
* Faster transactions
* Enhanced throughput

### Bridging Assets

Use bridges to move assets between L1 and L2 (e.g., [https://bridge.arbitrum.io](https://bridge.arbitrum.io))

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)

ZKPs allow one party to prove a statement is true without revealing the underlying data.

### zk-SNARKs

Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge

* Compact
* Efficient
* Verifiable on-chain

### Applications

* Privacy-preserving transfers (e.g., Tornado Cash)
* Layer 2 (e.g., zkSync)
* Identity verification (e.g., Proof of Humanity)

### Libraries and Tools

* [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)
* [circom](https://docs.circom.io/)
* [Zokrates](https://zokrates.github.io/)

## Exercises

1. Create a mock DAO using Aragon or DAOhaus.
2. Bridge ETH from Ethereum mainnet to an Optimistic Rollup.
3. Explore zk-SNARKs by creating a simple circom circuit and generating a proof.
4. Compare gas fees between L1 and L2 transactions using a faucet and test contracts.
