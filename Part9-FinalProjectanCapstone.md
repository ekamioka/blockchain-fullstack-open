# Part 9: Final Project and Capstone

## Objective

Consolidate your knowledge by building and deploying a complete decentralized application (dApp) using Solidity, smart contracts, frontend integration, and deployment techniques.

## Project Scope

Create a dApp that solves a real-world problem or demonstrates a complete blockchain use case.

### Suggested Themes

* Decentralized crowdfunding platform
* NFT minting and marketplace
* DAO for collective governance
* Token-based voting or reputation system
* DeFi savings or lending protocol (basic)

## Requirements

### Smart Contract

* Written in Solidity (>=0.8.x)
* Must include:

  * At least one core contract with multiple functions
  * Role-based access control
  * Events and logging
  * Tests using Truffle/Hardhat

### Frontend

* Developed using React and either Ethers.js or Web3.js
* Connects to MetaMask
* Allows interaction with deployed contract (e.g., read/write calls)
* User-friendly interface with status/error handling

### Deployment

* Smart contract deployed on testnet (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli)
* Frontend hosted via GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify

## Milestones

1. **Design**: Define problem, write specs, and UI wireframes
2. **Contract Development**: Write and test Solidity contracts
3. **Frontend Integration**: Build React UI and connect to smart contracts
4. **Testnet Deployment**: Deploy contracts and frontend
5. **Documentation**: README with setup, features, and usage
6. **Demo Presentation** (optional): Record or write a walkthrough

## Evaluation Criteria

* Functional correctness and security of contracts
* Code clarity, modularity, and documentation
* UI usability and frontend-backend integration
* Creativity and originality
* GitHub repo structure and commit history

## Bonus

* Use of Layer 2 (e.g., zkSync or Arbitrum)
* Integration with ENS, The Graph, or IPFS
* Unit testing coverage > 90%
* Implementation of basic CI/CD pipeline

## Final Tip

Treat your capstone like a portfolio project. Share it on GitHub, include a live demo, and consider writing a blog post to document your journey.
